# nano-tile-engine
Simple tile engine for C# and MonoGame

## Current Work In Progress Features
+ Simple input handling for mouse, keyboard and gamepad
+ Game state management
+ Simple Sprite handling
+ tilesets/spritesheet support
+ standard and isometric tile map rendering, supporting multiple layers
+ partial tiled map editor importing (.tmx)
+ Extendible map generation system (includes a basic BSP dungeon generator)

## Planned features
+ Animated sprites
+ Full tiled map support
+ Animated map layers
+ Collision map layer
+ Basic in-game user interface system
+ FOV calculations for maps
+ Pathfinding for maps (A*)

## Supported Platforms
Currently only built and tested on Mac OSX. Support is planned for Windows and Linux for version 1.0.
Porting to these platforms should be straight forward as the underlying MonoGame library works accross all of these platforms.
